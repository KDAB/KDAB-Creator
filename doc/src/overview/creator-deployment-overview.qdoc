    \title Deploying to Mobile Devices

    Deploy configurations in the \gui Project mode \gui {Run Settings} handle
    the packaging of the application as an executable and copying it to a
    location you want to run the executable at. The files can be copied to a
    location in the file system of the development PC or a mobile device.

        \o  \l{Deploying Applications to Symbian Devices}

            When you deploy the application for the \gui{Symbian Device} target,
            \QC automatically generates a Symbian installation system (SIS) file
            in the project folder and copies it to the connected device. You can
            sign the SIS file and wrap it in a Nokia Smart Installer for Symbian
            package. You can test and debug the application on the device.
        \o  \l{Deploying Applications to Linux-Based Devices}

            When you deploy the application on a Linux-based device target, such
            as \gui {Embedded Linux}, \gui Harmattan, or \gui{Maemo5}, \QC
            copies the application files to the connected device. You
            can test and debug the application on the device.

            You can create Debian installation packages for MeeGo Harmattan and
            Maemo 5 devices.
        \o \l{Deploying Applications to QNX Devices}

            When you deploy the application on the \gui{QNX} target, \QC generates
            a BAR package in the build directory and deploys it to the connected
            device. You can test and debug the application on the device.

        \o  \l{Publishing}

            When you are ready to publish the application on a publishing
            channel, you must make sure that the installation file meets the
            requirements for publishing and installing applications to the
            target devices.
