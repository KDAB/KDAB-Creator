    \title Deploying Applications to QNX Devices

    When you deploy the application on the \gui{QNX} target, \QC generates
    a BAR package in the build directory and installs it on the connected
    device. The contents of the BAR package are specified in the \gui{Application
    Descriptor File}.

    \image qtcreator-qnx-deployment.png "Deploy to device"

    The name of the generated BAR package is shown in the \gui{Bar package}
    setting. If the package already exists, it will be overwritten without
    prior notification.

    \section1 Application Descriptor File

    The application descriptor file needs to be created manually,
    or you can use the \gui{Application Descriptor} wizard to have a generic
    template generated. The wizard is available in \gui {File > New File or
    Project > BlackBerry > Application descriptor}. This wizard will also
    include a splashscreen.png and an icon.png file which are included in the
    application descriptor file.

    To tailor your BAR packages, you will have to manually edit the application
    descriptor file. For a full reference, see
    \l{https://bdsc.webapps.blackberry.com/native/documentation/com.qnx.doc.native_sdk.devguide/com.qnx.doc.native_sdk.devguide/topic/r_blackberry_tablet_dtd_intro.html}
    {Document Type Definition (DTD) for the application descriptor file}.
