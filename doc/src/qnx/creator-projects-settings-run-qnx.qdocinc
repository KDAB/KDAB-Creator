    \section2 Specifying Run Settings for QNX Devices

    To run and debug an application on a QNX device, you must create connections
    from the development PC to the device. Click \gui {Manage device configurations}
    to create a connection. For more information, see \l{Connecting QNX
    Devices}.

    When you run the application on the QNX device, \QC first creates a BAR package in
    using the settings in the Application Descriptor File. The default is to create the
    BAR package in the build directory. The BAR package is then deployed onto the
    selected device. For more information, see \l{Deploying Applications to QNX Devices}.
